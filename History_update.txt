 Session Start Endpoint Implementation

  1. Endpoint Created ✅
   - URL: {URL_API}/session/start/{sessionID}
   - Method: GET
   - Authentication: Requires valid API key in x-api-key header
   - Functionality: Forwards requests to remote server and returns the same response

  2. Environment Variables ✅
   - REMOTE_API_KEY = "654321" (stored in .env file)
   - REMOTE_URL_API = "https://gi_pos_all.fikricloud.my.id" (stored in .env file)

  3. Security Features ✅
   - API Key Validation: Verifies the provided API key exists in the database and is active
   - Hash Comparison: Uses secure hashed comparison for API key validation
   - Access Control: Only allows access with valid, active API keys

  4. Implementation Details ✅
   - Request Forwarding: Makes HTTP request to remote server using fetch API
   - Header Propagation: Forwards the request with the REMOTE_API_KEY header
   - Response Relay: Returns the exact response received from the remote server
   - Error Handling: Proper error handling for network issues and invalid configurations

  5. Route Registration ✅
   - File: src/lib/fastify/routes/sessions.ts
   - Registration: Added to main application in app.ts
   - Swagger Documentation: Includes proper schema documentation for API documentation

  6. API Flow ✅
   1. Client makes request to {URL_API}/session/start/{sessionID} with valid API key
   2. Server validates API key against database (checking hashed values)
   3. Server forwards request to ${REMOTE_URL_API}/session/start/{sessionID} with REMOTE_API_KEY
   4. Remote server processes request and sends response back
   5. Local server relays the response back to the client
